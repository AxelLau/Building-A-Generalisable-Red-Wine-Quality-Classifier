## Classifying-Red-Wine-Quality
This project aims to identify, build and tune a classification models to classify quality red wine samples based on their characteristics.
In order to achieve this, we will use a combination of red wine domain knowledge, such as their chemical properties and taste profiles, and statistical learning techniques, namely classification algorithms (Linear, Non-Linear, Tree-Based Algorithms etc.). We will also look towards tapping into deep learning methods, such as neural network classifiers, to further improve on the efficacy of our classification endeavours.
