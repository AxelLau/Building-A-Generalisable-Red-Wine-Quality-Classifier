## Classifying-Red-Wine-Quality
This project aims to identify, build and tune a robust classification model to classify red wines based on their quality.
In order to achieve this, we will use a combination of domain knowledge on red wines, such as their chemical properties and taste profiles, and statistical learning techniques, namely classification algorithms (Linear, Non-Linear, Tree-Based Algorithms etc.). We will also aim to tap onto deep learning methods, for instance neural network, to further improve on the efficacy of our model.
